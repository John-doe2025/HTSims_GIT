okay so the geometry is in such a way that inside the nacelle there are 6 battery packs in cuboidal form arranged as battery front top then bottom then middel top and bottom and then rear ones the top and bottom batteries are sepearted by the middle plate and there is a plate at the top and bottom of the batteries defining the three plates then there are 4 bulkheads one in front of battery front then bh2 is in middle of batt front and batt middle and so on there is another component which produces heat called the esc which is placed on the esc mount which is attached to the bulkhead 1 the materials and properties of every node is present in the config.py file

out of the three sims file simulation.py would give normal results in some cases and rubbish in others because there we defined the nodes as sources and sinks which keeps on changing as the simulation proceeds and sometimes the nodes defined as sources acts as sinks leading to a mess, simulation_fix.py was the 2nd idea where we implemented simple idea of following Q_obj1_obj2 = constant*(temp_obj2 - temp_obj1) and then adding up all the Q in net_q ehich made proper sense but we are still going somewhere wrong and producing physically impossible, simulation_final.py is just an experimental file to debug simulation_fix file
